<h2>Hello there! 😁👋🏼</h2>

My name is Rodrigo Andrade and I'm a developer born, raised and based in Brazil 🇧🇷. I've been working as Front-End Developer since 2017 and as a Mobile Developer since 2016, and I'm actively looking for work in the Front-End and Mobile Development areas. I'm passionate about turning ideas into projects and helping as many people as I can.

In my free time I like playing (and sometimes watching other people online playing) video-games 🕹, watching movies 🎞️, looking for all sorts of new tech stuff over the internet 📚, listening to (and definitely playing!) music 🎵. Last but not least, I like turning coffee ☕️ into code 💻.
